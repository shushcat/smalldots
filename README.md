This repository contains a few things to make working on remote machines much easier, or just to get a minimal habitable configuration up and running on a new machine.  Excluding Vim plugins under `_vim/pack/plugins/start/` and `_vim/plugin`, configuration is kept under 100 lines of code and is contained in the three files `_vim/vimrc`, `_profile`, and `_tmux.conf`.

### Installation

Just put the directory where you'd like it, then run the `install.sh` script.
