# minimd

Minimd is a small plugin for writing long [Markdown](https://commonmark.org/) documents in Vim.  It is mostly a simple implementation of the header visibility cycling idea from [Org Mode](https://orgmode.org/) for Emacs, which makes it easy to keep track of the contents of long documents by displaying outlines based on the headlines in those documents.  Its main features are

- Fast section folding, even for very long documents;
- Display of unfolded headers as outlines of their contents;
- A header motion command that ignores code blocks (so doesn't mistake `#` comments for headers);
- Basic task management with checkbox toggling, along with and `ACTV`, `TODO`, and `DONE` keywords;
- A word count, from Vim's fast builtin `wordcount()` function, in the status line, set to update only when toggling between insert and normal modes.

## Usage

| Normal Mode Key     | Action                                  | 
| ---------------     | --------------------------------------  | 
| `Space`             | Fold or unfold the current header.      | 
| _n_-`Space`         | Fold all headers of level _n_.          | 
| `Tab` or `]`        | Jump to next header.                    | 
| `Shift-Tab` or `[`  | Jump to previous header.                | 
| `=`                 | Promote header (`#` → `##`).            | 
| `-`                 | Demote header (`##` → `#`).             | 
| `Enter`             | Add and toggle checkboxes in lists      | 
|                     | (`-` → `- [ ]` → `- [x]` → `- [ ]`).    | 

As always in Vim, you can execute any command from Insert mode by prefixing it with `Ctrl-o`; so, for example, you would toggle a checkbox without leaving Insert mode by typing `Ctrl-o` followed by `Enter`.  For more on executing Normal mode commands from Insert mode, consult `:help i_CTRL-o`.

## Exporting with Pandoc

If you would like to export your Markdown file to another format, [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) can probably do what you want; you can easily set keybindings to facilitate repeated exports.  For instance, the sequence `<Leader>ep` could be set to export a PDF of the current Markdown file by adding the line `autocmd FileType minimd nmap <Leader>ep :!pandoc -f markdown -o example.pdf '%'` to your `vimrc`.  See [the Pandoc manual](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html) for an overview of its many options.
